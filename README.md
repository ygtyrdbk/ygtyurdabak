Hello, it's Yiğit. I am a senior Management Information Systems student in İstanbul/Turkey
I am currently working on game development. 
I am currently learning Unity and C#. 
Here is my Linkedin account : https://www.linkedin.com/in/yigit-yurdabak/
Open to any collabrations and job offers.
Also I am trying to find a bootcamp. 
Ask me anything about game development so maybe we can together find a solution.
